Provides a framework for an interface for Zoom links. 

If your teacher doesn't give you a link, then you can make one by taking the meeting id and adding it to https://us02web.zoom.us/j/, like so:

https://us02web.zoom.us/j/[meeting_id_with_no_spaces]


==============================================



If you want to do it manually, download ```base.html```
Replace the link variables, and put the names of your classes after the Roman Numerals.

If your class needs a password, call the copyToClipboard(password) function and have a password variable set.

Remove the ones with passwords you don't need! Feel free to edit away
